## How does it work?

AdMob by Google helps you monetize your mobile app through in-app advertising. Ads can be displayed as banner ads, interstitial ads, video ads, or native ads â€” which are seamlessly added to platform native UI components. On Android, you can additionally display in-app purchase ads, which allow users to purchase advertised products from within your app.

Before you can display ads within your app, you'll need to create an AdMob account and activate one or more Ad Unit IDs. This is a unique identifier for the places in your app where ads are displayed. If you are already using AdMob in your app, all of your existing Ad Unit IDs continue to work after you've added Firebase to your app.

AdMob uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK. The Google Mobile Ads SDK helps app developers gain insights about their users, drive more in-app purchases, and maximize ad revenue. In order to do so, the default integration of the Mobile Ads SDK collects information such as device information, publisher-provided location information, and general in-app purchase information such as item purchase price and currency.
