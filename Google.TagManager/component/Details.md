Developers can use the Google Tag Manager interface to implement and manage measurement tags and pixels in their mobile applications, without having to rebuild and resubmit application binaries to app marketplaces. Developers who are working with Firebase Analytics can easily add Google Tag Manager to help manage and make changes to the implementation, even after the app has shipped.

Developers can log important events, and decide later which tracking tags or pixels should be fired. Tag Manager currently supports tags for the following products:

* Firebase Analytics
* Google Analytics
* DoubleClick
* AdWords
* adjust
* AppsFlyer
* Apsalar
* Kochava
* Tune
* Custom Function Calls (for other products)
